Change History
===============================
Version 0.4 (beta) 08/xx/2023:
Enhancements:
	- Improved interface for working with remote engineering presets and artemis.ini settings.
	- Reworked the settings, mods, and missions interface for remote control.
	- Added local/remote editing (text editor) and management for controls.ini and DMXControls.xml.
Other changes:
	- Significant change to the layout of the UI to handle remote management of Artemis.ini and engineering presets.  A lot of stuff got moved
		around because of this.  Some resizing to keep the window height down to 700 pixels high. This height is to account
		for smaller screen PCs.

------------------------------
Version 0.3 (beta) 07/30/2023:
Bug Fixes:
	- If, while viewing Engineering presets, a presets file was deleted from the folder where Engineering Presets is stored, it would not be removed from the list.
	   This could potentially crash the app.  Fixed so that it does get removed.
	- Artemis SBS is started from Artemis Manager, but stopped by exiting Artemis SBS normally,
		you would not be able to start Artemis SBS again from Artemis Manager until you restarted
		Artemis Manager.  Clicking "Stop" would crash the application.  Coded to occasionally check
		that Artemis SBS is still running (once every 5 seconds), and also fixed so that clicking "Stop" will no longer
		crash the application.
Enhancements:
	- Added code to automatically back up the original version of artemis.ini from the vanilla Artemis, for each Artemis version that gets snapshotted.
	- Added context menu on Engineering presets file list, which includes ability to rename files.
	- On Adding an engineering presets file, changed to auto name the file instead of using a file dialog.  This way the user can't try to move the file
		to a location other than the required folder.
	- Added ability to change settings in artemis.ini that control local settings (such as default screen size and station restriction)--basically
		any setting that would have nothing to do with a mod.  Remaining settings will to be added as part of new functionality to be used for creating
		a mod.
------------------------------
Version 0.2 (beta) 07/25/2023:
Bug Fixes:
	- Added check for when browsing for Artemis SBS install location to verify that the artemis.exe file exists before setting the Artemis Install folder.
	- If the Activated Mods folder (<user>/AppData/Roaming/Confederate In Blue Gaming/Artemis Manager/Activated) doesn't exist (Artemis install has never been snapshotted),
		clicking the button to browse to it would fail (would browse instead to the Documents folder).  Added code to ensure the Activated folder will exist when
		trying to browse to it from the browse to folder button.
	- Added ability to uninstall Artemis snapshots, even if that snapshot is active.  However, uninstalling an Artemis snapshot remotely is still blocked.

Other changes:
	- Moved "Install Mod" button to be on the "Installed Mods" and "Installed Missions" tabs.
	- Some minor layout changes.
	- Added Menu.
	- Added ability to edit Engineering presets.
	- Added links to Artemis SBS Upgrade install files for download and install.  Will add to the available list as other people submit them to me.
	- Added links to external useful tools for download and install.
	- Added a setup window and moved settings to it.  Expansion is planned for adding localized Artemis.ini settings.
	- Added backup/restore of controls.ini
	- Added backup/restore of DMXCommands.xml
